Client Overview: Tracked 3,000 clients with segmentation by gender and joining year.

Loan Analysis: Visualized total loans (₹4.38bn), business lending (₹2.60bn), and credit card balances with detailed breakdowns by income bands, occupations, nationality, and banking relationships.

Deposit Analysis: Showcased total deposits (₹3.77bn), savings/checking accounts, and analyzed deposit trends across different demographics and customer profiles.

Summary Section: Consolidated key KPIs including foreign currency holdings, superannuation savings, and fee structure.

This project demonstrates data storytelling, financial analysis, and dashboard design best practices to support strategic decision-making in the banking sector.
